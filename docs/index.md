## First 5 Minutes

This quickstart verifies that the service is reachable and can process one validation request.

### 1. Start the service

Run your deployed container (or local instance) with the required environment variables configured.

### 2. Check health

```bash
curl http://localhost:8080/admin/health
```

Expected response:

```json
{"status":"ok"}
```

### 3. Check loaded models

```bash
curl http://localhost:8080/models
```

Pick one `model` and `version` from the response.

### 4. Validate a payload

```bash
curl -X POST "http://localhost:8080/models/<model>/versions/<version>:validate" \
  -H "Authorization: Bearer <token>" \
  -H "Content-Type: application/json" \
  -d '{
    "payload": {
      "id": "example-001",
      "name": "example record"
    }
  }'
```

Expected response shape:

```json
{
  "passed": true,
  "results": []
}
```

If your auth mode is `none`, you can omit the `Authorization` header.
